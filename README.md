# Abstract:

We built a website interface that allows a user to create idea cards and submit them onto the webpage. They have the option to toogle the display to present their favorited ideas or to display all ideas that they have been created.

### Installation Instructions:

- Fork and clone this repository to your preferred directory
- Type `cd ideaBox` to move into root directory
- Open the page by typing `git open index.html`

### Context:

We had completed the intended functions of the project by day 5 since receiving of the project. We took the rest of the weekend to do CSS cleanup and refactor what created functions that we could. This comes within our 4th week of Mod1. An aproximative 30 hours were dedicated to the completion of this project.

### Learning Goals:

Our goals were to effectively learn and utilize the DOM to raw code HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to created a workable and presentable website. Other goals we had were to learn how to work cooperatively together with asynchronous schedules. Learning clear communication and keeping team members abreast of changes, as well as scheduling conflicts.

### Wins + Challenges:

We were able to utilize each of our individual talents to spearhead parts of the project which paralleled our strengths. Those who were skilled in Javascript, mainly worked with this code, those skilled in CSS would focus on the design. After creating a foundational skeleton webpage to work towards, we shadowed each other to gain insight on the work processes each other had in order to gain a better understanding of which ever part of the project that we deemed our weakness. Joey and Brendan had shadowed and work cooperatively with Gavin at the start of the project to build the HTML skeleton since this was deemed as their weakness. A challenge we faced was unexpected life occurances that removed each of us away from the project for a time. This caused us to keep into contact with each group member in order to continue the necessary process to complete the project during one or more team member's temporary absence.
